* This project is a fun clone of a Classic Arcade Game, to demonstrate Object-Oriented JavaScript, use of the HTML5 Canvas, and a game engine.

### Summary of third-party resources used:
* Initial starter code provided by Udacity
https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game

### Hosting / Deployment
Copy the entire directory contents to the hosting server, including the css, images, and js folders.

### GamePlay
* To play the game, navigate the browser to the index.html file.
* While avoiding bugs, navigate the player from the grass, across the busy road, to the water, using the up / down / left / right keys.
* A collision with a bug ends the game.
* Reaching the water will begin the next level.
* To win the game, see how many levels you can complete!
